=======
As a Software Developer, I have gained experience in programming and testing through education and hands-on roles. My Software Developer Internship allowed me to work with Java, SpringBoot, Angular, Azure, and MongoDB while developing key skills in communication and time management. I collaborated effectively with team members, listened to feedback, and managed multiple tasks to meet deadlines. My involvement in sports and societies during my Computer Science studies at Dalhousie University further enhanced my organizational skills and teamwork abilities. I am committed to continuous learning and eager to stay updated on industry advancements, always looking for new opportunities to grow and apply my skills.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BennyMugisha](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BennyMugisha)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BennyMugisha/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Programmed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent resource to collect system and hardware specifications. Developed Bash Scripts to automate the installation of required docker containers and SQL running processes. Configured the Crontab to automate the collection of the Linux system resource usage. Followed the Software Development Life Cycle for GitFlow to track and modify my development of the scripts.

**RDBMS and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BennyMugisha/tree/master/sql)]: Integrated the database configuration for PostgreSQL to set up the initial exercise practice. Designed and tested a database using an ERD from an exercise about building data for club members, bookings, and facilities. Provided solutions to questions about database management and queries by following the PostgreSQL documentation.


## Highlighted Projects
**Open Chat App**: Implemented an interactive design that helps users navigate the app and find other users without difficulty. Utilized Electron as the main development provider of the cross-platform application.

**Random Crawler and Projection**: Analyzed machine learning statistics to predict the random crawler. Used Jupyter Notebook to write codes that will be presented as a double project.
