summary: As a Software Developer, I have gained experience in programming and testing through education and hands-on roles. My Software Developer Internship allowed me to work with Java, SpringBoot, Angular, Azure, and MongoDB while developing key skills in communication and time management. I collaborated effectively with team members, listened to feedback, and managed multiple tasks to meet deadlines. My involvement in sports and societies during my Computer Science studies at Dalhousie University further enhanced my organizational skills and teamwork abilities. I am committed to continuous learning and eager to stay updated on industry advancements, always looking for new opportunities to grow and apply my skills.
